  <p>I am a Web Developer and Computer/Server Engineer. I have built several Front-End websites for my clients through <em><strong>Knight Digital Media, LLC</strong></em>. My experience in Computer/Server Engineering comes from about 5 years of
    working in the IT field whereas building and deploying servers has always been a hobby. I love learning new things, playing video games, and reading. I am currently in the process of learning Full-Stack development so that I may provide my
    clients better results and better websites. At the moment I am learning about Full-Stack Web Development, Docker, Linux, and Networking in addition to my formal education. I also religiously play Sea of Thieves with my friends and Mass Effect
    Legenday Edition when they aren't around. I also love listening to The Weeknd, he's my favorite artist! You can listen to my Spotify playlist <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0rgokHuYsptEpmJYSUHMeQ?si=f028c22ec8824801">here</a>.</p>
